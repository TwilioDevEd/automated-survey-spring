      ## Automated Survey

      Have you ever wondered how to create an automated survey that can be answered over phone or SMS?

      This tutorial will show how to do it using Twilio API.

      #### Here's how it works at a high level

      ![Automated Survey Diagram](//s3.amazonaws.com/howtodocs/automated-survey.png)

      1. The end user calls or sends an SMS to the survey phone number.

      1. Twilio gets the call or text and makes an HTTP request to your application asking for instructions on how to respond.

      1. Your web application instructs Twilio (using [TwiML](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml))
         to [`Gather`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/gather) or
         [`Record`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/record) the user input over the phone,
         and prompt for text input with [`Message`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/message)
         if you are using SMS.

      1. After each question, Twilio makes another request to your server with the user's input, which your application stores on its database.

      1. After storing the answer, our server will instruct Twilio to [`Redirect`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/redirect)
         the user to the next question or finish the survey.

      ## Create a Survey

      In order to perform automated surveys we first need to have some
      questions to ask. For your convenience, the application's
      repository already includes one survey that can be loaded into
      the database. If the database is configured correctly this
      survey will be loaded into the database when the app starts.

      You can modify the questions from the survey by editing the
      [survey.json](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/blob/master/survey.json)
      file located in the root of the repository and re-running the app.

      We want users to take our survey, so next we will implement
      the handler for SMS and calls.

      ## The Interview Loop

      It is helpful to visualize your interaction with a user during a survey as a loop.
      The chart below shows how that interaction will be handled. (click to enlarge):

      ![Survey Flow Chart](//s3.amazonaws.com/howtodocs/flowchart.png)

      The user can answer question for your survey over the phone using either their phone's keypad or by speaking.
      After each interaction, Twilio will make an HTTP request to your web application with either the string of
      keys the user pressed or a URL to a recording of their voice input.
      
      For SMS surveys the user will answer questions just by replying
      with another SMS to your Twilio number where we got the question from. 

      It's up to the application to process, store and respond to the user's input.

      Let's dive into this flow to see how it actually works.

    :markdown
      ## Configuring a Twilio Number

      To initiate the interview process, we need to configure one of our [Twilio numbers][numbers]
      to send our web application an HTTP request when we get an incoming call or text.

      [Click on one of your numbers][numbers] and configure Voice and Message URLs that point to your server.
      In our code, the routes are `/survey/call` and `/survey/sms`, respectively.

    data-highlight='25-41, 81-85')
    :markdown
      ## Responding to a Twilio Request

      Right after receiving a call or an SMS, Twilio will send a request to the URL specified on the number's configuration
      (/survey/call for calls and /survey/sms for sms).

      Each of these endpoints will receive the request and will use a `TwiMLResponseBuilder` to return
      a welcome message to the user. For phone users, the built message will contain a `Say`
      verb with the message or a `Message` Verb for SMS.

      It will also include a `Redirect` verb to the question's endpoint to continue with the survey flow.

    data-highlight='32-62')
    :markdown
      ## Question Controller

      This endpoint will just check if it's a SMS or Call, instantiating the proper class to build the correct TwiML response.
      Each type of question and interaction (Call/SMS) will produce different instructions on how to proceed.
      For instance, we can record voice or gather a key press during a call, but we can't do the same for text messages.

      When the user is interacting over SMS we don't have something like an ongoing call session with a well defined state.
      It becomes harder to know if an SMS is answering question 2 or 20, since all requests will be fired to `/survey/sms` main endpoint.
      To solve that, we can use [Twilio Cookies](//www.twilio.com/blog/2014/07/the-definitive-guide-to-sms-conversation-tracking.html)
      to keep track of what question is being answered at the moment. That is done by `createSessionForQuestion` method.

      Let's see how the response is built.

  .step(data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/survey/util/TwiMLResponseBuilder.java',
    data-highlight='54-72')
    :markdown
      ## Building Our TwiML Verbs

      If the question is of "numeric" or "yes-no" kind then we use the
      [`<Gather>`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/gather)
      verb. However, if we expect the user to record an answer we use the
      [`<Record>`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/record)
      verb. Both verbs take an `action` attribute and a `method`
      attribute.

      Twilio will use both attributes to define our response's endpoint that will be used as callback. That endpoint
      will be responsible to receive and store the caller's answer.

      During the Record verb creation, we also ask for a [Transcription](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/transcription).
      Twilio will process the record and extract useful text, making a request to our response endpoint when transcription is done.

      Now let's see what to do with the response.

  .step(data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/survey/controllers/ResponseController.java',

    :markdown
      ## Handling responses.

      After the user has finished speaking and pressing keys, Twilio just sends a request telling what happened and asking for further instructions.

      At this point, we need to recover data from Twilio's request parameters (`ResponseParser` does that) and store them on `persistResponse` method.

      Recovered parameters vary according to what we asked on the questions, they can be:
      * `Body` contains the text message from answer over SMS.
      * `Digits` contains the keys pressed for a numeric question.
      * `RecodingUrl` contains the URL for listening a recorded message.
      * `TranscriptionText` contains the result of a recording transcription.

      Finally we redirect to our Question controller, which will ask the next question on the loop.
      This is done on `redirectToNextQuestion` method.

      Now, let's see how to visualize the results.

      ## Display the survey results

      For this route we simply query the database using a JPA query
      and then display the information within a Mustache template. We
      display a panel for every question on the last survey, and
      inside every panel we list the responses from different calls.

      You can access this page in the applications root route `/`.

      That's it!

      If you have configured one of your Twilio
      numbers to the application built in this tutorial you should be
      able to take the survey and see the results under the root route of
      the application. We hope you found this sample application
      useful.  If you're a Java developer working with Twilio, you
