# Automated-survey-spring

[![Build and test](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

[Read the full tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/automated-survey/java/spring)!

## Requirements

In order to run this application, you need to install Oracle's JDK (Tested with JDK7)

## Database setup

The application uses PostgreSQL as a database engine. In order to get the application up and running you should
configure:

* Set environment variable `DATABASE_URL` as it's shown in the .env.example file
* If your Postgres installation doesn't have SSL support enabled, you must set `TWILIO_DISABLE_DB_SSL=true`

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
$ source .env
```

Running the application will also run the database migrations.

## Running the application

### Using Gradle

If you already have Gradle installed, you should be able to run the application using `gradle bootRun`. This will
install all dependencies and build the application. If no other port is specified the app will run in port `8080`.

If you don't have gradle installed, you can use the Gradle Wrapper included in this project. Just go to the root directory
of the project and prepend any gradle task with the executable `./gradlew`. You can run the application by running
the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

If you would like to see request and response content in the console use `--debug` as follows:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --debug
```

If you open you browser on `http://localhost:8080` you should see the list of questions that were specified in the
`survey.json` file. Once you have completed totally or partially a survey, you will be able to see the answers here
as well. This is only possible after you have set up your Twilio number to make a request to `/survey` on your server.

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

If you want to run the app within IntelliJ, you can follow these steps:

* Open IntelliJ and select the import project option. You can either select the directory where you
cloned the repository (using git) or the one where you unpacked a copy of the project.

* Specify that the project your are trying to import is using gradle:

![Import gradle project](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_select_gradle.png)

* Configure your project by selecting the options to match what you see on
the next screenshot. The Gradle JVM field depends on your local java installation.

![Configure gradle project](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_configure_project.png)

* The project is now imported and all its dependencies should have been already downloaded. The next step
is to configure IntelliJ to run the application. You can do this by clicking the `edit
configurations` button under the run menu.

![Edit run configurations](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_run_configurations.png)

* On this menu select the Application option from the left sidebar. Then you must fill in
the necessary information for your application to run as shown on the next screenshots:

1. Select the main class for the project.

![Select main class](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_select_main_class.png)

![Select main class menu](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_select_main_class_menu.png)

2. Set the required environment variables for the application to run.

![Set environment variables](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_set_environment_variables.png)

![Set environment variables menu](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_set_environment_variables_menu.png)

Remember you must set `TWILIO_DISABLE_DB_SSL` only if your postgres installation doesn't have SSL
enabled. If that's not the case, you can set that variable to false, or simply not set it.

3. Your run configuration should look like this:

![Final configuration](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_final_config.png)

* The final step is to run the application. You can do this by finding the main class on the
project explorer and right click on it. There you can select to run the application.

![Run application](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/intellij_run_application.png)

Then you application will be running on `port 8080` by default.

### Using eclipse

There is an eclipse based IDE for Spring app development [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools).
You can download this IDE if you want to try the eclipse experience with the app.

If you have an existing eclipse installation, you can install the Spring tool suite from the
eclipse market place [Spring Tool Suite (STS) for
Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse). This will allow you
to run this spring application with minimal configuration. You will also need a gradle plugin for
eclipse as this IDE doesn't support Gradle natively. You can install [Buildship Gradle
Integration](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration) plugin for eclipse
directly from the eclipse marketplace.

Once you have these plugins installed, you can import your gradle project from the `File` menu in
eclipse and follow the steps of importing your project. The only thing left to do is to
configure how the application will run. You can access the run configuration from the `Run` menu in
eclipse:

![Run configuration](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/eclipse_run_configurations.png)

On the new configuration window you should specify how the Spring application will
run. You should set up the necessary environment variables and run the application when you
are done.

![Set environment variables](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/eclipse_set_environment.png)

If you didn't run the application on the previous step, you can run it by right clicking on the
root of the project explorer and set `run as -> Spring Boot App`

![Run application](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/eclipse_run_app.png)

Then you application will be running on `port 8080` by default.

## Configuring Twilio to call your application

### Exposing the app via ngrok

For this demo it's necessary that your local application instance is
accessible from the Internet. The easiest way to accomplish this
is by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). If you're running OS X you
can install ngrok using Homebrew by running `brew install ngrok`.
First you need to make sure the application is running in you localhost.
You can run the application directly from the command line using gradle or in any IDE you like.
The previous steps describe how to run the application using Gradle or IntelliJ IDE.

After this you can expose the application to the wider Internet by
running (port 8080 is the default for Spring):

```
ngrok 8080
```

### Configuring Twilio's webhooks

You will need to provision at least one Twilio number with voice
capabilities so the application's users can take surveys. You can do
that
[here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/search). Once
you have a number you need to configure your number to work with your
application. Open
[the number management page](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming)
and open a number's configuration by clicking on it.

![Open a number configuration](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/number-conf.png)

Next, edit the "Request URL" field under the "Voice" section and point
it towards your ngrok-exposed application `/survey/call` route. Set
the HTTP method to GET. If your application is running in production
you need to point Twilio to
`http://<your-app-name>.com/survey/call`. See the image
below for an example:

![Webhook configuration](https://raw.github.com/TwilioDevEd/automated-survey-spring/master/screenshots/webhook-conf.png)

Give your number a call, answer the example questions and then go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

The results of the survey should be there.

## Running the tests

Running the tests with gradle is as simple as executing `./gradlew test` on the command line. Just remember to set up
the correct `DATABASE_URL` environment variable as running the test will delete all the records in the database.
